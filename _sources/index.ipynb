    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`dolfinx_optim` is a convex optimization add-on package to the `FEniCSx` finite-element library. It provides a simple Domain-Specific Language through FEniCSx `dolfinx` Python interface for solving convex optimization problems. In particular, it relies on the `Mosek` mathematical programming library. `Mosek` provides a state-of-the art interior-point solver for linear programming (LP), convex quadratic programming (QP), second-order conic programming (SOCP) and semi-definite programming (SDP).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{seealso}\n",
    "This project is a rewrite of the [`fenics_optim` package](https://gitlab.enpc.fr/navier-fenics/fenics-optim) working with the legacy FEniCS version.\n",
